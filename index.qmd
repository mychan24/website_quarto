**Profile:**\
I am a cognitive neuroscientist at the [Wig Neuroimaging Lab](https://vitallongevity.utdallas.edu/cnl/) in the Center for Vital Longevity. I completed my Ph.D. in Cognition and Neuroscience at the The University of Texas at Dallas.

**Research:**\
My research focuses on how our experience and environment interacts with the brain's functional network organization. My recent work showcases how socioeconomic status moderates the aging of functional brain network ([published in *PNAS*](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/E5144)), and how educational attainment can predict decline in brain network organization, which, in turn is prognostic of future dementia severity ([published in Nature Aging](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-021-00125-4)).\
\
My work uses network/statistical analysis (R, Python, Matlab, Cytoscape) to explore brain-environment relationships in data collected via multimodal neuroimaging (FSL, SPM, FreeSurfer).

**Life:**\
I have a strong interest in how data analytics is used to unveil hidden patterns in various big data. In my spare time, I train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, film wedding videos, and unwind by watching science/education videos ([video-list](https://micaelachan.com/video-list)).
